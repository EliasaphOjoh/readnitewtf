			<p>So in case you realise that you are again and again falling in love with people who by no means love you back, then there is a cause of this issue.
			If you find that you are always getting drawn to people who by no means pay attention and give you back your love, then maybe you need to take a minute and think about why this keeps taking place. Everybody is deserves true love, and so do you. So what is it that you are doing wrong? In this text, I will talk about some of the things that cause you to fall in love with the wrong women or men. So keep reading.</p>
			<h2>You don’t love yourself</h2>
			<p>If you don’t love yourself, nobody else will, except your mum. You know that. Unless you like yourself and take good care of yourself for whom you are right now, you will by no means get the affection you're hoping for. Unless you confront your demons and heal your emotional wounds, you will not ever like someone the proper way.
			When you're emotionally wounded and are fearful of confronting your pains, you're clearly making it worse. Avoiding your pain or burying it far is never going to make you feel better. You will keep falling in love with the wrong people because you are relying on them to make you have a sense of feeling better. You wish that they will provide you with the love that you are not able to offer yourself. But that’s no longer how love works. You have to  love and appreciate yourself for a person so that they experience the same for you. Only then will you get the love you've been attempting to find your entire life.
			The answer lies in loving yourself first.</p>

			<h2>You are so impulsive when it comes to loving</h2>
			<p>You go searching and spot all of us in strong relationships or marriages. All of them seem so satisfied and lucky to have the other, and the affection they share makes you wish which you too had that in life.</p>

			<p>However much you have happiness for them, it mostly makes you feel lonely and unloved.
			This makes you rush into relationships with people who may not be looking for something like you are, so your eagerness prevents you from having such a romantic relationship. So because you're eagerly and desperately seeking out love, you turn out to be falling for the wrong woman or man. Love can in no way be rushed, nor can it be forced. You need to be patient in case you want actual love in your life. Love will come to you when you are ready. And most importantly, it will come to you whilst you are very patiently waiting for it.</p>
			<h2>You are waiting for the wrong person to change</h2>
			<p>You understand deep down that the person you are dating  will in no way change, however you are convincing yourself that it is all worth it in the long run. Optimism is a good satisfaction to have, but there may be a difference between being optimistic and being delusional.
			Love shouldn't be converting each other, nor must it be about ensuring that your associate is exactly like you. If you cannot receive them for whom they are, then you definitely are with them for the wrong reasons. On the other side, the negative matters that hassle and harm you about them—if they don’t respect you sufficiently to want to paint themselves and change, then in reality you are no longer vital to them.
			</p>

			<h2>You are afraid of being alone</h2>
			<img src={un2} alt="Why women start to hate their men" />
			<p>Getting into dating because you feel being on your own might be among the most worst mistakes you can ever make in terms of finding love. True love can ever germinate from desperation or the worry of being. Getting right into a courting just due to the fact everyone else is courting is by no means the right solution. Keeping strong will make you feel greater later.
			The need for attention and wanting someone to shower you with affection and love all of the time, so as to feel a little less lonely may assist for a very brief time, but it’s only a matter of time before the truth breaks free and you're compelled to confront the reality. Settling for less than what you deserve will only give you extra pain, and by the time you recognize this, you will be left with a broken coronary heart.
			Being alone is not a terrible factor, rather, it can help you get some clarity as to what kind of man or woman you really are, and what kind of someone you want to be with. It can also assist you recognize love much more better. Solitude is a valuable treasure, which must never be dealt with as a curse.</p>

			<h2>You are always holding onto your past</h2>
			<p>It’s definitely no longer a great idea to get into a new dating, to be able to recover from the previous one. You might feel great for a few days, however after some small time, all of the unresolved issues are going to catch up with you.
			You will keep falling in love with the wrong people till you figure out yourself and your troubles. It might start out as a rebound relationship, and before you know it, you've already fallen for them, however unluckily for you, they have not. It’s very crucial to get over a broken relationship, make peace with it, flow on, other than getting worries with another other person. 
			Love should by no means be forced, nor can it be rushed. Getting into a relationship just for the sake is going to give you extra pain in the end. Wait for the rightful person to come back alongside, and look ahead patiently for them to locate you and agree with me, it's going to locate you whilst you least assume it. Patience here does not mean you sitback and do nothing, stay home or avoid people. Nope. Engage yourself in more public activities and get to kno people. Get friends. From those people and their circles you may find your love. So be patient dont rush to love and don't sit back. Be on the look out.</p>
			<p>Our subconscious mind attracts us to certain types of individuals who trigger in us a particular feeling, be it nice or awful feelings. We generally tend to interprete that feeling as “chemistry”, and this leads us to believe that we have discovered “the one”, or at the least a near approximation to that</p>

			<h2>And lastly</h2>
			<p>Imagine, you've never had a chance to see a diamond in your entire life, but you have gotten atleast to hear much stuff about diamonds. Then getting a diamond becomes really  simple.
			Take for example, if you know that true love is not forced, true love will blend and match with you and love you back, true love takes you for who you are, all these things you know about love clearly will direct you. So always keep your senses on and where things seem not to be right, put some question marks. </p>
			<p>So you may find that the person you are with has some really negative charcteristics, they lie to you, they hide stuff from you, they alays look suspecious, all these things that irritate.</p>
			<p> By this time you will understand that, “Everything that glitters isn't always gold.”
			You have simply another piece of stone which just shines, however deep down it's far worthless. Since it was your choice to have it, it's so difficult to accept the reality and you keep convincing yourself.
			Then you realise, you've fallen in love with another mismatched man or woman. But you understand it comes with its own benefits.
			Maybe you don’t understand what this diamond really looks like. What it feels like to have one.
			But now you know, what its like to stay with a the stone. Next time, you won’t make the same mistake while a choosing your life companion for yourself and probably you recognize a way to keep away from stones.</p>
