			<h1>6 possible reasons why your vagina itches. Medical advice</h1>
<p>Experiencing vaginal itching can be uncomfortable and concerning. While it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and medical advice, here are six possible reasons why your vagina may be itching:</p>

<h2>Yeast Infection (Candidiasis):</h2>
<p>A common cause of vaginal itching is a yeast infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida fungus. It may also cause a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge and redness or swelling in the vaginal area.</p>

<h2>Bacterial Vaginosis:</h2>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the balance of bacteria in the vagina is disrupted. Symptoms may include vaginal itching, grayish-white discharge with a fishy odor, and irritation.</p>

<h2>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs):</h2>
<p>Certain STIs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis, can cause vaginal itching along with other symptoms like abnormal discharge, burning during urination, or pelvic pain.</p>

<h2>Contact Dermatitis:</h2>
<p>Allergic reactions or irritation from certain products like soaps, douches, laundry detergents, or synthetic underwear can cause itching in the vaginal area.</p>

<h2>Menopause:</h2>
<p>Hormonal changes during menopause can lead to vaginal dryness, itching, and irritation due to decreased estrogen levels.</p>

<h2>Skin Conditions:</h2>
<p>Skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or lichen sclerosus can affect the vulva and cause itching and discomfort.</p>
<p>It's important to note that self-diagnosis can be challenging, and these are just possible causes. If you're experiencing vaginal itching or any related symptoms, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They can perform a thorough examination, evaluate your medical history, and conduct any necessary tests to determine the underlying cause and provide personalized medical advice and treatment options.</p>

<p>Additionally, practicing good genital hygiene, avoiding irritants, wearing breathable underwear, and avoiding sexual activities until the cause of the itching is identified can help minimize discomfort and reduce the risk of further irritation.</p>
