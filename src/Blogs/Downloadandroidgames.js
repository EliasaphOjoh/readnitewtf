			<p>Hey friends. Today we shall talk about downloading Android games in detail right here today.Downloading games to your phone is tiresome at times depending on your downloading knowledge and the resources you have (mobile data or wi-fi) but we shall only talk about the knowldge part, since everyone is aware that there needs to be an internet connection to download games depending on their size. That been said, let me introduce you to the tw methods you can download a game from the internet to your android phone/tablet.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Google Play Store</li>
				<li>Webites on the internet</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Downloading games from the Play Store</h2>
			<p>This method is pretty straight forward. Most android gadgets come with this app(Play Store) pre-installed. Others may however have older versions or not have Play Store at all.to get you started, <a href="https://google-play.en.uptodown.com/android/download">download Google Play now.</a></p>

			<h2>Downloading android games over websites (Third Party Providers)</h2>
			<p>If you do not have access to a game from the playstore, or would just like to install it manually on your phone, then its cool for you to go ahead and search for it on third party websites like this one. Download it and then install it by tapping on the downloaded APK.
			And if the application you want to install to your phone has OBB files, its better you refer to our guide about <a href="what are OBB files.html">OBB files</a> to be able to install the apps better and with ease.
