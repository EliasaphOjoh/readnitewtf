			<h1>5 Ways To Deal With Your Toxic Girlfriend</h1>

			<h2>1. Confront her about it.</h2>
			<p>The first thing that you need to do is talk to her about it. Stay calm and explain that you want to keep dating but that there are some things she does that you cannot tolerate anymore. Give her examples of the behavior that bothers you and explain how she makes you feel in those moments.
			For instance, you could explain that you require honesty, respect, loyalty, and transparency to be happy and content in your relationship.</p>

			<h2>2. Set clear boundaries.</h2>
			<p>The most important part of all this is setting clear boundaries. Some people will abuse you simply because you stay quiet about it and let it slide. Speak up for yourself and learn to say “no.”
			When something bothers you, say it aloud. Don’t bottle it all in. Set clear boundaries and let her know when she’s about to cross them.
			This is not something that you can do only once for it to work. You have to keep speaking up for yourself and sticking to your boundaries. Don’t let her push them, even if it means that you show a willingness to walk away.</p>

			<h2>3. Hear her side of the story.</h2>
			<p>You should give your girlfriend the benefit of the doubt. If you can communicate with her without it being about who wins the argument, let her tell you her side of the story. Maybe there are things that she can tell you to explain some of her bad behavior. Hey, she might even be willing to apologize and work on herself.
			So, give her a chance to say what she has to say for herself. Don’t be aggressive, and actively listen to her arguments. Encourage her to open up because all of these problems might have something to do with the bad experiences that she had in the past or her mental health issues. Hear her out and let her know that you want to work on this if she will put in the extra effort too.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Work on making compromises.</h2>
			<p>She can’t always get what she wants, and you need to work on making compromises so that you can both benefit from this relationship. Again, you will need to speak up for yourself. If you do not want to do something or act in a certain way, talk to her about it and see if there’s a different solution that could work for both of you.
			Suggest alternatives when you’re not happy with her suggestions. Making compromises is not easy for everyone, so be prepared that the only compromise you might be able to make is to agree that you need couples therapy.</p>

			<h2>5. Suggest therapy.</h2>
			<p>If you want to save your relationship, your best bet is to try therapy. Encourage your girlfriend to talk to a therapist and tell her that you’ll support her every step of the way. Explain that she could talk to someone by herself or you could do it together but that it’s likely the only solution to the current state of your relationship.</p>

			<h2>6. Consider ending the relationship.</h2>
			<p>In the end, consider walking away from your girlfriend if she really is that toxic, especially if you have tried all the previous steps and she refuses to put in her share of the work and/or try therapy.
			You deserve to be with someone who cares about your needs and your happiness, not just what they can gain from you and how they can control you. So, when you show a willingness to walk away from her, consider walking away for good.
			Still not sure whether your girlfriend is toxic, or what to do if she is?
			We really recommend you speak to an experienced relationship expert about it. Why? Because they are trained to help people in situations like yours. They can listen to you describe your girlfriend’s behavior and help you identify the toxic and not-so-toxic patterns in it. They can then offer tailored advice to help you improve the situation one way or another.
			A good place to get help is the website Relationship Hero – here, you’ll be able to connect with a trained and compassionate relationship counselor via phone, video, or instant message.
			You’ve already taken the first step just by searching for and reading this article. The worst thing you can do right now is nothing. The best thing is to speak to an expert. The next best thing is to implement everything you’ve learned in this article by yourself. The choice is yours.
