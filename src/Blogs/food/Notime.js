<p>When you're short on time but still want to enjoy a delicious and nourishing meal, quick and easy recipes come to the rescue. Here are a few ideas that can be prepared in a flash:</p>

<h2>Veggie Stir-Fry:</h2>
<p>Heat a skillet or wok, add a drizzle of oil, and quickly stir-fry your favorite vegetables like bell peppers, broccoli, snap peas, and carrots. Add a protein of your choice, such as tofu or pre-cooked shrimp or chicken. Season with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Serve over cooked brown rice or noodles for a satisfying meal.</p>

<h2>Quinoa Salad:</h2>
<p>Cook quinoa according to package instructions and let it cool. In a bowl, combine the cooked quinoa with chopped vegetables like cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and fresh herbs like cilantro or basil. Dress with lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add some crumbled feta cheese or roasted chickpeas for extra flavor and protein.</p>

<h2>Avocado Toast with Egg:</h2>
<p>Toast whole grain bread and spread mashed avocado on top. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. In the meantime, cook an egg to your liking (fried, poached, or scrambled). Place the cooked egg on the avocado toast and garnish with chopped fresh herbs or red pepper flakes for a quick and satisfying breakfast or lunch option.</p>

<h2>One-Pot Pasta:</h2>
<p>In a large pot, combine your choice of pasta, diced tomatoes, sliced onions, garlic, and any vegetables you have on hand (such as spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms). Add vegetable broth and simmer until the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened. Season with herbs, salt, and pepper. Finish with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast for a simple and flavorful one-pot meal.</p>

<h2>Baked Salmon with Roasted Vegetables:</h2>
<p>Place salmon fillets on a baking sheet and season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Toss a variety of vegetables like asparagus, cherry tomatoes, and sliced bell peppers with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange them on the same baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Serve with a side of quinoa or steamed rice.</p>

<h2>Bean and Veggie Quesadillas:</h2>
<p>Spread a layer of refried beans on a tortilla. Top with shredded cheese, chopped vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and corn kernels. Fold the tortilla in half and cook in a skillet over medium heat until the cheese melts and the tortilla is crispy. Cut into wedges and serve with salsa, guacamole, or sour cream.</p>

<p>Remember, these recipes are meant to be quick and easy, so feel free to modify them based on your preferences and the ingredients you have available. With a little creativity and minimal cooking time, you can still enjoy tasty and nutritious meals even on your busiest days.</p>
