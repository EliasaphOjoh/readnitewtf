Plan your meals for the week in advance, creating a shopping list based on the ingredients you already have and the sales or discounts available. This way, you can avoid impulse purchases and utilize ingredients efficiently, minimizing waste.</p>

<h2>Get Creative with Affordable Proteins:</h2>

These ingredients can be the base for hearty and nutritious meals such as bean soups, lentil curries, frittatas, and stir-fries. Incorporate them into dishes with flavorful spices, herbs, and vegetables to create satisfying and budget-friendly meals.</p>

<h2>Opt for Versatile and Budget-Friendly Ingredients:</h2>
<p>Certain ingredients are known for their versatility and affordability.

<h2>Minimize Food Waste and Repurpose Leftovers:</h2>
