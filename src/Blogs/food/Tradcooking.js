<h2>Wok Stir-Frying (China):</h2>

Stir-frying creates vibrant and aromatic dishes like Kung Pao chicken and chow mein noodles.</p>

<h2>Ceviche (Peru):</h2>

This technique is also popular in other Latin American countries.</p>

<h2>Clay Pot Cooking (Various Cultures):</h2>

<h2>Pit Roasting (Polynesia and Indigenous Cultures):</h2>
