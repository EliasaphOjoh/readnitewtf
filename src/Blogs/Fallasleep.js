			<h1>3 of the best working ways to fall asleep in 10 mins or less. One is a military method</h1>
<p>When it comes to falling asleep quickly, there are a few techniques that some people find helpful. One of them is a military method called the "4-7-8" technique. Here are three techniques, including the military method, that you can try to fall asleep in 10 minutes or less:</p>

<h2>The 4-7-8 Technique (Military Method):</h2>
<p>Sit or lie down comfortably and place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue behind your upper front teeth.<br />
Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whooshing sound.<br />
Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four.<br />
Hold your breath for a count of seven.<br />
Exhale completely through your mouth to a count of eight, making the whooshing sound again.<br />
This completes one breath. Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths.</p>

<h2>Progressive Muscle Relaxation:</h2>
<p>Find a comfortable position in bed and close your eyes.<br />
Starting from your toes, focus on tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in your body, moving progressively upward.<br />
Tense each muscle group for a few seconds, then release the tension, feeling the relaxation flow through your body.<br />
Move from your toes to your feet, calves, thighs, abdomen, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, and finally your face and scalp.<br />
Take slow, deep breaths throughout the process and continue until you've relaxed your entire body.</p>

<h2>Deep Breathing and Mindful Meditation:</h2>
<p>Find a comfortable position in bed and close your eyes.<br />
Take slow, deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath entering and leaving your body.<br />
As you breathe, try to clear your mind of any racing thoughts or worries.<br />
If your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.<br />
You can also try visualizing a peaceful scene or repeating a calming phrase in your mind to enhance relaxation.<br />
Continue the deep breathing and mindful meditation for several minutes, allowing yourself to gradually relax and drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>Not every technique works for everyone, and it may take some practice to find the method that works best for you. It's also important to establish a consistent sleep routine, create a sleep-friendly environment, and practice good sleep hygiene habits to support healthy sleep patterns. If you continue to experience difficulties falling asleep or have chronic sleep issues, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance.</p>
