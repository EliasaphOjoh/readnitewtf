It may be experienced during sex, but also during other penetration, like inserting a tampon. \u201cSome find the tightening sensation so severe that they cannot handle any degree of penetration and others describe a burning sensation that develops as penetration is prolonged or deepened.\u201d"}),(0,Da.jsx)("h2",{children:"Can sex be painful because of stress?"}),(0,Da.jsx)("p",{children:"While there are plenty of physical conditionals that can be causing painful sex, the source can also be related to your mental health as well. \u201cIf we\u2019re stressed, our body is going to be way more tense typically, and our muscles are going to contract and that can include the pelvic region. We may hold quite a bit of tension in our pelvic floor, and that can [cause] pain during penetration for folks,\u201d Kova says. She goes on to explain that for most people, stress can cause reduced feelings of arousal. \u201cWe experience stress as something that\u2019s telling our body we\u2019re in danger.

Kova shares a similar sentiment, urging folks to follow what feels good and find their own sexual voices. \u201cSex is not about performance. It\u2019s really, truly about your pleasure.

In one episode, an evil billionaire by the name of Charles Forstman offers Harvey Specter \u2014 the protagonist lawyer of the show \u2014 a job. Harvey declines, saying that he doesn\u2019t want to work for him and that he\u2019ll soon be making half a million dollars annually anyway.

But then, Charles Fortman\u2019s gardener \u2014 a job that takes less work to master than learning the law \u2014 makes a lot more money than him. Why? Simply because WHO you\u2019re working for is again, much more important than how hard you work. Of course, I\u2019m not suggesting that one should work for evil billionaires. But just pointing out that who you\u2019re associated with matters a lot as well. I haven\u2019t yet reaped the benefits of this tangent of Naval\u2019s quote. But I plan to do it soon.
